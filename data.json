          "title": "Louder Volume",
          "description": "Aftermarket cat-back systems often use larger diameter pipes and less restrictive mufflers/resonators, allowing exhaust gases to flow more freely. This results in a louder, more pronounced exhaust note compared to stock systems."

          "title": "Deeper or Sharper Tone",
          "description": "Cat-back systems with resonators produce a smoother, deeper tone, while those without resonators sound sharper and raspier."

          "title": "More Aggressive Character",
          "description": "Many performance cat-back systems are tuned to emphasize a sporty or race-inspired sound, with more crackles, pops, or backfires depending on the car and setup."

          "title": "Active Exhaust Valves",
          "description": "Some cat-back systems feature active exhaust valves that let drivers switch between quiet and aggressive sound modes, offering both comfort and performance at the push of a button or automatically based on driving conditions."
